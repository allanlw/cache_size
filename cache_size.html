A web worker is currently measuring your CPU cache size<noscript style="color: red"> or at least it would be if you didn't have javascript disabled</noscript>.<br/>
The test iterates through arrays of different sizes, and accesses elements with a given stride in a psuedo-random order (to defeat prefetching).<br/>
Showing 32-bit integer access time (plus loop overhead) in nanoseconds, with relative from previous size in parens.<br/>
Rows are array size, columns are stride.
